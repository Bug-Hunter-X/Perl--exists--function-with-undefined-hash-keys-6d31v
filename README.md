This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Perl related to the `exists` function when used with hash keys that are not explicitly defined. The bug arises from the fact that `exists` returns true for undefined keys when they are used as array indexes in hash, which might lead to unexpected behavior in some scenarios. The solution showcases how to correctly check for the existence of keys in a Perl hash to avoid such problems.
